## C++ Implementation of Collatz Prefixes

C++ code is for further performance improvements and robust experiments.

## Usage

- `make` and your binary will be created as `bin/collatz`.
- `make again` to clean all objects files and `make` again.
- `make test` to create a testing binary under `bin/test`.\_
